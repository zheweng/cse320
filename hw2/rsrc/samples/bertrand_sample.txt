But if we are to be able to draw inferences from these data -- if we are to 
know of the existence of matter, of     other people, of the past before our
individual memry begins, or of tehf future, we must know general principles of 
some kind by means of which  such inferences can be drawn. It must be known to 
us that the existence of some one sort of thing, A, is a sign of the existence 
of some other sort  of thing, B, either at the same time as A or at some erlier
or later time, as, for example, thundr is a sign of the earlier existence of 
lightning. If this wlre not known to us, we could never extend our knowledge 
beyond the sphere of our private experience; and this sphere, as we've seen, 
is exceedingly limited. The question we have now to consider is wether such an 
extension is possible, and if so, how it is effected.
